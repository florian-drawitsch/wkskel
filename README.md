# wkskel

--- A python library for scientific analysis and manipulation of webKnossos skeleton tracings ---

In very broad sense, `wkskel` represents a python library for analysis and manipulation of *undirected acyclic graphs*, throughout the package referred to as __skeletons__. In a more applied sense, these skeletons typically represent neurite center-line reconstructions obtained manually using the in-browser neurite annotation tool [__webKnossos__](https://webknossos.brain.mpg.de/) or generated by automated methods. 

The `wkskel` library aims at providing the data structures and methods necessary to facilitate analysis, manipulation and visualization of such skeletons in a scientific workflow. Furthermore, it provides an input-output-interface to the __.nml__ format used by webKnossos.

## Package installation with pip (pypi)

To install the package via pip and the python package index:
```bash
pip install wkskel
```

## Package installation with pip (local)

To install the package locally run pip install in the wkskel main folder:

all code on the system via:
``` bash
pip install -e .
```

To create a conda environment for wkskel run the following command in the wkskel 
main folder:
``` bash
